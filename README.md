# Toolbase 

Toolbase is a web app for Toolhub records management, whereby users get to keep record of the tools they improve daily by contributing data. 

This is a responsive web application.

This web app was built by Bootstrap framework, some HTML, CSS and abit of Javascript 

I used vanilla Javascript because I was most confident about using it and also that it was a requirement at this stage

This repository can be cloned from my github account and stored locally in the PC for view 

There are three parts of this project
* The Homepage
* The Dashboard
* The Leaderboard 


## Homepage 

This is where we get to display tool data for users to fill in the missing information if they are able to

The users that contribute data correctly get to earn points 

Those that contribute to the data displayed have the option to skip it and move on to the next tool 


## Dashboard 

This page shows contribution metrics. Data has been recoreded such as;
